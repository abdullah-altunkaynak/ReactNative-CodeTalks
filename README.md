# ReactNative-CodeTalks
This project is a messaging application using Nosql(firebase) database. The user registers, creates a room and sends a message. Messages are visible to other users. Information about when the messages were sent and by whom is also displayed.
**** Update Ideas ****
1- Message notifications can be enabled.
2- Personal (private) messaging can be created.
3- File sharing can be supported.
4- Maintaining profile information can be helpful. (Photo, situation, etc.)
